# angular2-virtual-scroll

Virtual Scroll displays a virtual, "infinite" list. Supports multi-column.

## About

This module does not render every record in the list at once; instead a small subset of records just enough to fill the viewport are rendered and reused as the user scrolls. Thus displaying an infinitely growing list of items in a viewport of size just about a couple rows in an efficient way is made possible.

* Supports multi-column
* Angular 2 compatible module
* Easy to use apis
* OpenSource and available in GitHub

**Note:** Items must have a fixed height and width for this module to work perfectly.

## Demo

[See Demo Here](http://rintoj.github.io/angular2-virtual-scroll)

## Usage

```
<virtual-scroll [items]="items" (update)="viewPortItems = $event">

    <list-item *ngFor="let item of viewPortItems" [item]="item">
    </list-item>

</virtual-scroll>
```

## Get Started

**Step 1:** Install angular2-virtual-scroll

```
npm install angular2-virtual-scroll --save
```

**Step 2:** Import virtual scroll module into your app module

```
....
import { VirtualScrollModule } from 'angular2-virtual-scroll';

....

@NgModule({
    ...
    imports: [
        ....
        VirtualScrollModule
    ],
    ....
})
export class AppModule { }
```

**Step 3:** Wrap virtual-scroll tag around list items;

```
<virtual-scroll [items]="items" (update)="viewPortItems = $event">

    <list-item *ngFor="let item of viewPortItems" [item]="item">
    </list-item>

</virtual-scroll>
```
